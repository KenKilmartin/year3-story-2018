        <p> Something was pouring from his mouth. Blood !!! BLOOD crimson copper smelling blood he had a weary look upon his brow and dripping off his mandibles. </p>
		<p> The kind of look that made me double think should i serve this weary looking insectoid.  I second guessed myself and thought now you are being speciest the insect overlords now have equal rights.</p>
        <p>I greeted the insectoid the same way I did all my customers which nowadays only trickle in from time to time usualy walk around my bar ask about price and leave, I greeted the insectoid with a smile andtried to mutter out te same phrase but at this point it feels so reharsed the words have lost there meaning to me "Greatings Traveler, welcome to my humble abode is there any delicasy I can tempt you with ", I did'nt even get to finnish my speil before he interupted me he spoke with almost deep raspy voice "Which way to your bathroom I want to clean up" to which I replied "the restroom vacilities are only for paying customers" The insectoid then threw a whole slice pan a whole slice pan I have not seen this much bread since before the massive cold snap that froze the planet, there by making bread the primary currency which was ironic as in the old times people refered to money as bread. He just let out another Booming voice "just give me your finest drink and let me use the bathroom". Go on said I as I looked at the bread and start planing all the things I would buy. All this time I wondered why he was covered in blood and what was going to happen next ...  </p>
