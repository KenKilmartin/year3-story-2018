        <p>The whole time this creature was in the bathroom I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and my breath felt laboured. I had always got this way around insectoids and always suspected them of mischief.</p>
        <p>But, I took a deep breath and began to pour him a pint of Guinness as I had known the insectoids where quite fond of the hops that are used in brewing it. As I was doing the second part of the pour my hand started to shake I realised I had not eaten any fresh food now in going on 4 days only canned produce.  </p>
        <p>It was at this moment I looked up and there he was standing in front of me, he had cleaned all the blood off him for a moment. I had thought I better not ask him where it had come from but another part of me wanted to know. I hope it was not someone I had known's blood.</p> <p> He had just shoot me a glare with his arm/tentacle outstretched trying to claw at the Guinness. It was at that moment an instinct took over me I acted in a way you would if you see a child doing something bold and I hit away his arm and said wait until the pint has settled.  </p> <p> <b>What had I done, the insectoids are known for their short tempers.</b>What happened next really surprised me ... </p>
