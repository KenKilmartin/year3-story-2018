        <p>The Insectoid looked at me and said "you know what human you are right thank you but do not touch me again" my heart beat hundred times a minute to which I could only reply "You are right sir I am very sorry"   </p>
        <p> The insectoid then let out a sigh and said "Human would you like to hear a story" to which I responded "yes very much so"   </p>
        
        <p>He sat down and nursed his pint of guiness "Ok then I will let you know how bread has become the main currency of the planet now many years ago there was a cold freeze as you know in Ireland " I nodded in agreement " and with this all supermarkets sold out of all fresh produce and mainly bread " </p>
        <p>To which i replied "why yes i remember that very well but how did bread become main currency  " he replied "Well people started to go crazy for bread and offering to sell at crazy prices, this is when us insectoids realized if we imerged now with our bread making  skills we could rule" </p>
        <p> "What we didnt expect was that there would be a global shift in thinking of bread as a form of currency" </p>
        <p> With that he finnished his pint and walked out of the bar. </p>
